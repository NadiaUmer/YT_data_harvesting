**YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing Dashboard**
This project involves building a comprehensive dashboard using the Streamlit library that provides users with the ability to access, analyze, and manage YouTube data. The dashboard is designed to collect YouTube data, store it in both MongoDB and SQL databases, and enable users to perform various data analysis tasks. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

Step 1: Set Up the Streamlit Dashboard
Utilize the Streamlit library to create an interactive dashboard. Streamlit offers a user-friendly way to design and deploy web applications for data analysis. Refer to the Streamlit documentation to learn more about building performant and responsive Streamlit apps.

Step 2: Enable YouTube API Access
To access YouTube data programmatically, you'll need to enable the YouTube Data API through the Google Developers Console. Obtain API credentials that will grant your application access to YouTube's data. Refer to the YouTube Data API documentation to understand how to set up and manage API credentials.

Step 3: Scrape YouTube Data
Utilize the google-api-python-client library to interact with the YouTube Data API. This will enable you to extract details about YouTube channels, playlists, videos, and comments. The API offers methods to fetch relevant information about videos, playlists, channels, and more. Follow the documentation provided by Google to effectively retrieve the desired data.

Step 4: Store Data in MongoDB
Create a MongoDB database and appropriate collections to store the extracted YouTube data. The pymongo library allows you to interact with MongoDB databases from your Python application. Design the structure of the collections to accommodate channel details, playlist information, video data, and associated comments. Refer to the pymongo documentation for guidance on setting up and working with MongoDB.

Step 5: Migrate Data from MongoDB to SQL
Depending on the nature of the data, establish the required tables in a MySQL database. The pymysql library enables you to establish a connection with a MySQL server and manage data migration. Transform the data as needed to fit the SQL schema and use SQL queries to insert the migrated data into the appropriate tables.

Conclusion
By following these steps, you'll be able to create a dynamic Streamlit dashboard that interacts with the YouTube Data API, extracts relevant data, stores it in both MongoDB and SQL databases, and provides users with a powerful platform to analyze and visualize YouTube data. This project brings together web development, API integration, data storage, and data analysis, providing you with valuable hands-on experience in building end-to-end data solutions.
